      <p class="descript">
        The University of Texas at Austin chapter of Latinos in Engineering and
        Sciences, or Texas MAES, was established in 2015 by a group of enthusiastic and
        driven Latino students that wanted an organization to promote success
        and grant opportunities to other Latino students in their community.

      <!---<h2 class="subtitle">History of our Chapter</h2>
      <p class="descript">
        The founding of this student chapter was a work of art orchestrated by
        Clara Neri-Meji, a member of the Austin MAS Professional Chapter. In the
        spring of 2015, she had a vision of starting a student chapter of MAES
        at the The University of Texas at Austin. During SXSWEdu she met a Texas
        Advanced Computer Center employee by the name of Rosalia Gomez. During
        their conversation, the topic of founding a student chapter came up.
        Rosalia informed Clara of a student on campus, Lisandro Rodriguez, who
        she previously worked with that might be interested in starting a chapter.
        Clara reached out to him in hopes of finding a student to assist in this
        noble endeavor. After a lunch meeting with Clara and Tony Gonzalez, another
        member of the Austin professional chapter, Lisandro agreed to help found
        the chapter. Shortly after this conversation, recruiting quickly took place
        at the beginning of the school year and by Octobr, we had a full set of
        officers to represent Texas MAES and begin setting the foundation for
        the future of the organization.
      </p>
      <p class="descript">
        Lisandro Rodriguez, John Fuentes, Airam Garay, Victoria Arredondo, Giovanna
        Loredo, and Edward Baca became the official founding members of the chapter.
        Lisandro seeked out Dr. Rodolfo Jimenez, a STEM Coordinator at the Longhorn
        Center for Academic Excellence and past MAES member to be the official faculty
        advisor. The group applied to become an official student organization on
        campus. With all the pieces in place, the paperwork was filed and the chapter
        became official at the 2016 Symposium in Las Vegas.

        Since the humble beginnings of the chapter, it has more than doubled in size and
        has participated in many events both on campus and with other chapters. We have
        learned a lot when it comes to being a part of the MAES familia. We hope to continue
        to grow our chapter in the years to come.
